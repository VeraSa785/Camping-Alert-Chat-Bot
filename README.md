# Camping-Alert-Chat-Bot
This is my project for receiving notifications when specific campsites become available. As many people know, it can be difficult to find an open spot at your favorite campsites in Washington State. This chatbot will send you notifications when a specific campsite becomes available.

Here's how it will work:

- The chatbot will exist on the Telegram messenger app. To use it, you'll need to download the app.
- Find your chosen camping spot on the https://www.recreation.gov/ website. Copy the ID of the campsite from the URL and send it to the chatbot.
- The chatbot will then ask you to specify your preferred time period and days.
- You can also set up alerts and choose how frequently you want to receive notifications (e.g. every 5 or 10 minutes). Once you secure your spot, you will stop receiving notifications and receive a final message.

Tech stack: Telegram messenger, Python.

This is my first project for creating a chatbot, so stay tuned for updates.

Please don't share this with people lol
